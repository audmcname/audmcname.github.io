_I spend 5 minutes in the evening to draw a one-panel comic from my day, based on one of Lynda Barry's journaling methods._

This is my daily comic website. [Here is my main website](https://audmcname.com), for comics drawn in more than 5 minutes and illustrations and stuff.

This website is hosted on GitHub pages using Jekyll.
